# RustyFusion
RustyFusion is an open-source server emulator for Cartoon Network's MMO Fusionfall written in Rust inspired by the [OpenFusion project](https://github.com/OpenFusionProject) in which I am an active contributor. RustyFusion was initially an experiment for me to gain experience writing Rust but is now on course for eventual feature-completion. **Please note that, until then, RustyFusion is NOT ready for use as a production Fusionfall server!**

## RustyFusion vs. OpenFusion
- **Compatibility:** RustyFusion is designed to work with general-purpose Fusionfall clients, as it speaks the original Fusionfall network protocol. This means that [OpenFusionLauncher](https://github.com/OpenFusionProject/OpenFusionLauncher) can connect to a RustyFusion server with no extra work. RustyFusion's SQL-based backends also use the OpenFusion database schema, and RustyFusion uses the same tabledata repository as OpenFusion for data sourcing. It is fully compatible with [ofapi](https://github.com/OpenFusionProject/ofapi) for secure login and account administration. It also supports the [OpenFusion monitor protocol](https://github.com/OpenFusionProject/ffmonitor) and is thus compatible with [OpenFusionMap](https://github.com/OpenFusionProject/OpenFusionMap-rs) and [computress](https://github.com/OpenFusionProject/computress-rs).
- **Performance:** RustyFusion is built on fully asynchronous I/O, including network and database operations. Where OpenFusion's main loop services clients serially with blocking DB access, RustyFusion can service packet handling and database queries across many clients concurrently on a **multi-threaded runtime**. In informal testing this translates to roughly a **5–10x improvement in concurrent request throughput** under load, as well as the ability to execute long-running DB operations (such as bulk player saves) without freezing the server.
- **Extensibility:** RustyFusion ships with a **Luau engine**, and all mob behavior is defined at a high level in Luau scripts with a growing API surface. Custom scripts can be added and assigned to mobs and NPCs through commands, and scripts can be **hot-reloaded at runtime**.
- **Safety:** Because RustyFusion is written in Rust as opposed to OpenFusion's choice of C++, it is, in theory, **much less** prone to memory safety issues, security vulnerabilities, and undefined behavior than OpenFusion's implementation of the game while maintaining the performance of compiled machine code.
- **Scalability:** Unlike OpenFusion, RustyFusion's login server and shard server can be compiled as **two separate binaries** that communicate to each other over the network, allowing for a more flexible server architecture with multiple shard servers. The login server can select the optimal shard for a player based on **geographic location** as well as shard population. A fallback mechanism is also in place to move players to another shard if the shard they are on fails gracefully for whatever reason.
- **Reliability:** RustyFusion comes after years of writing, refactoring, and evaluating OpenFusion code. There were a handful of cut corners and bad design decisions made in the development of OF that this project aims to avoid. Some already implemented examples include the increased usage of high-level types, a proper logging system, strict error-handling, and stricter packet validation ("anti-cheat"). These changes should lead to a cleaner codebase with less bugs.
- **Completeness:** OpenFusion is not technically complete in and of itself. There's a handful of features that remain unimplemented at the time of writing, such as channels, certain built-in commands, and NPC v. NPC combat. RustyFusion aims to close the gap on as many of these features as possible.

### Known Issues
- The AI script for mob pack followers currently errors out.

Items that are ***highlighted*** are in planning or WIP. Items marked with `+` are either new and not present in OpenFusion or enhanced from OpenFusion (bug fixes not included). Some items have dependencies in other categories, so the list won't get completed in order.

## Developing
**RustyFusion requires an instance of a supported database backend (currently only PostgreSQL, but SQLite support is planned) to connect to for database operations.** You can manually configure an instance and set the connection parameters in `config.toml` or, for PostgreSQL specifically, use `docker compose` to spawn a container with the default parameters.

Cargo (Rust's package manager) makes working with Rust projects extremely easy to setup. Just clone the repo (recursively, to grab critical tabledata), build, and run:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/gsemaj/RustyFusion
cd RustyFusion
cargo build
cargo run --bin login  # for login server
cargo run --bin shard  # for shard server
cargo run --bin hybrid # for combined login/shard server
```
To force the server to load the config file from a location other than `config.toml`, you can override the path in the command line with `--config=`. You can also override any number of individual config settings with `--section.key=value`.
```
cargo run --bin shard --config=some_other_config.toml
cargo run --bin shard --general.db_port=1234 --shard.num_channels=2
```

## Contributing
If you have code you want to contribute, make sure you follow the general code style and run the following commands before you commit your code (CI/CD will catch you if you don't):
```
cargo fmt
cargo clippy
```

## Other Notes
### On Creative Liberties
Although RustyFusion tries to match the front-end behavior of OpenFusion closely, there are some notable, intentional differences that exist between the two. I only diverged on these because I think they lead to an overall improved experience.
- Mob behavior may not be identical to OpenFusion. The behaviors are written in Lua from the ground-up. Although care is put in to ensure the combat experience is as close as possible to OpenFusion, there may be small, subtle differences.
- Not all OpenFusion custom commands will be supported (particularly "gruntwork" commands) and brand new custom commands are added as good use cases come up.

### Disclaimer
RustyFusion is a **personal project that I work on in my free time**, so it is unlikely to progress at a constant pace.

Feel free to email or DM me if you have any questions about the project or are interested in contributing.
